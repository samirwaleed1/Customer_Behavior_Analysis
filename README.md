# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
# Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow**, starting from raw data loading and exploration to insights delivery through interactive dashboards and professional reporting.  
The goal of the project is to extract meaningful insights from data using **Python, SQL Server, and Power BI**, and communicate results clearly to stakeholders.

## Dataset
- Source: Provided dataset (CSV / Excel format)
- Size: Medium-sized analytical dataset
- Content: Contains transactional and customer-related data used for analysis
- Purpose: To analyze trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs)

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning  
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **SQL Server**: Data storage and analytical SQL queries  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard creation  
- **Gamma**: Presentation (PPT) creation  
- **Git / GitHub**: Version control and project documentation

## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas.
   - Performed initial data inspection (shape, columns, data types).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed distributions, trends, and correlations.
   - Identified missing values, outliers, and data quality issues.
   - Created visualizations to understand key patterns.

3. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values.
   - Standardized column formats and data types.
   - Prepared cleaned data for SQL and BI usage.

4. **SQL Analysis (SQL Server)**
   - Imported cleaned data into SQL Server.
   - Wrote analytical queries using:
     - Aggregations
     - Joins
     - Filters
     - Window functions
   - Extracted insights to support business questions.

5. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Built a star-schema-friendly data model.
   - Created interactive visuals (KPIs, charts, and filters).
   - Enabled slicing by key dimensions (time, category, customer, etc.).

6. **Reporting & Presentation**
   - Created a structured analytical report summarizing findings.
   - Designed a professional presentation (PPT) using **Gamma** to highlight insights and recommendations.

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Key KPIs (totals, averages, growth metrics)
- Trend analysis over time
- Category and segment breakdowns
- Interactive filters for deeper exploration
